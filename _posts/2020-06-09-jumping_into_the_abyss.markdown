Have you ever experienced a moment in your life where everything was about to change but you had no idea how? 


Let me back up a little bit.  I've been a career retail employee since my work history began, moving from sale associate roles to store manager roles.  Back in 2016, I took the opportunity of a lifetime to move from my home state of Missouri to the gorgeous island of Maui for work.  This was the first time in my life that I allowed myself to fully give up control and leap into the unknown and it scared the wits out of me.  A big part of this decision was the yearning I had to ~*find myself*~ and to find my own footing in life.  After moving to California in 2018, I set out to work on my mental health and worked with two really fantastic therapists.


In February this year, I had an "aha" moment: I wasn't happy in California or in my career.  While I loved certain aspects of my job, the mundane details of trying to find shift coverage and the like, were wearing thin on me.  I also realized how much I was missing my family and the gatherings that made me happy: my niece and nephew's birthdays, major holidays.  With this realization, I decided moving back to Missouri was in order.  Luckily, with no job and no plan on what to do, my dad offered to let me stay with him upon my arrival so I could get my footing.  I'm very thankful for that and that he supports me in basically any life decision I make, but I still had to figure out what I was going to do to transition out of the retail sector.  So began my next jump into the abyss, trusting that I would land where I needed.


I was sharing all of this with my most recent therapist along with the fact that I was feeling a bit lost in life overall with no clear direction on what I wanted to do.  I've always been a firm believer in not putting myself into considerable debt in order to obtain an education, which made me feel like my options were very limited.  He's the one that actually brought up coding bootcamps as a possibility, essentially letting me know that there are lower cost options in order to make a career move.  While I hadn't thought about coding prior to this conversation, I started to do some research into it.


At this point, I also started thinking about my past interests and my present interests.  In high school, back in the early aughts, when Myspace was still the top social networking website, I taught myself HTML & CSS from viewing other webpages sources.  I found it to be incredibly fun to be able to build a website from scratch, including designing graphics for them.  I had always found languages to be of interest and, a few years after graduating, I found myself enrolled in classes for American Sign Language interpreting.  I finished that program but never went into the interpreting field for various reasons, but still have a reverence for the language, as well as the customs and traditions of the Deaf community.


As I continued my research into coding as a possibility, the more it started to feel like a good option for me.  Not only did I love languages, of which coding has numerous, but I also loved the idea of creating something out of nothing.  All of this paired with the possibility of working a more "typical" work week seemed to draw me in.  At this point, I figured my best bet would be to enroll in a short term, low cost bootcamp to see if this was something that still interested me.  Two weeks into that program I decided to take the plunge and to invest in myself and my future by enrolling in the Flatiron School's program and the rest, they say, is history.  While jumping into the abyss may seem frightening to begin, it's almost always going to be worth it if you trust that the pieces will fall where they need, and I have absolute confidence they will.
